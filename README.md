# Navigate-The-Labyrinth
- We created Navigate The Labyrinth, an interactive maze game, for honing game development skills. It challenges players to find the quickest route from start to finish with minimal moves. Developed as a mini project in real-time game web development with my friend, it offers a thrilling and engaging experience.
- We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this game, a visually appealing UI for our fun and engaging maze project.
